## 🧠 What I Learned

### Linear Regression
- Feature scaling significantly affects model performance
- Lasso regularization reduces overfitting by penalizing weak features
- Correlation heatmaps are essential for identifying multicollinearity

### Logistic Regression
- Class imbalance directly impacts accuracy and needs to be handled
- Confusion matrix reveals model weaknesses beyond just accuracy score
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score give a fuller picture than accuracy alone

### KNN
- Choosing the right value of K heavily impacts performance
- Cross-validation helps prevent overfitting and gives reliable accuracy estimates
- KNN is sensitive to feature scaling — normalization is essential

### Naive Bayes
- Works surprisingly well even with the "naive" independence assumption
- Very fast to train and effective for classification problems
- Performs well even with small datasets
